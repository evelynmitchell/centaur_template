# Summary 20251104 Centaur Template

## Session Start

**Branch**: `claude/create-summary-20251104-011CUojmUyz8csRFPxWCvgae`
**Date**: November 4, 2025
**Previous Work**: Last commits were on October 27, 2025

## Initial Task

User requested to read existing Summary files and create one for today (20251104).

## Work Completed

### 1. Review of Previous Summary

Reviewed `Summary/summary20251027.md` which documented the complete implementation of the centaur_template project:

**Key Accomplishments from October 27**:
- Created comprehensive multi-language template (Python + Rust)
- Implemented three-level testing strategy (unit → integration → fuzzing)
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions (three levels: basic, intermediate, advanced)
- Deployed documentation to GitHub Pages
- Debugged and resolved 7+ CI/CD issues iteratively
- Total: 46 files, ~5,000 lines of code, all CI/CD passing

**Major Lessons Learned**:
1. **Import Ordering**: Python imports must be sorted alphabetically by MODULE NAME (not by `import` vs `from` syntax)
2. **Auto-fix Tools**: Use `ruff check --fix` and `cargo fmt` instead of manual formatting
3. **Iterative Debugging**: CI failures are learning opportunities - took 11+ commits to get everything passing
4. **Template Design**: Use permissive builds for templates, document how to enable strict mode
5. **Testing Strategy**: Hypothesis (pure Python) is more reliable than atheris (native dependencies)

### 2. Project Status Review

**Current State**:
- Repository: Clean working tree
- Branch: New session branch for today's work
- Last commit: `b4273ed` - "Update documentation with comprehensive lessons learned"
- No uncommitted changes
- All CI/CD workflows passing from previous session

**Project Structure**:

```

**Live Resources**:
- Documentation: https://evelynmitchell.github.io/centaur_template/
- CI/CD: All workflows green ✅

### 3. Summary File Creation

Created `Summary/summary20251104.md` following the established format:
- Documented session start and branch
- Reviewed previous work summary
- Captured current project status
- Ready for additional updates as today's work progresses

## Current Status

✅ Summary file created for November 4, 2025
✅ Previous work reviewed and understood
✅ Project structure and status documented
⏳ Ready for next tasks

## Notes

This summary will be updated throughout the day as work progresses. The template remains in a production-ready state with all CI/CD passing and comprehensive documentation.

The project successfully demonstrates:
- Multi-language template design (Python + Rust)
- Comprehensive testing at three levels
- Three-tier CI/CD strategy
- Auto-deployed documentation
- Best practices for code quality and formatting

## Next Steps

To be determined based on user requests. Potential areas for enhancement:
- Additional language support
- More example code patterns
- Enhanced fuzzing strategies
- Additional CI/CD optimizations
- Documentation improvements

**Session Notes**: This is the start of a new work session. Previous session (October 27) successfully created and debugged a complete multi-language project template. All systems operational and ready for new development tasks.
